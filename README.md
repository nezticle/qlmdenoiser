Command line tool using OpenImageDenoise https://www.openimagedenoise.org/ to denoise qlm_*.exr lightmaps generated by Qt Quick 3D.

TODO only Windows is supported now. Run prepare_deps.bat first. Then qt-cmake-private -CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . and ninja.
This gives a qlmdenoiser.exe with the 3rd party dependencies linked in statically.

Once this is done, bake lightmaps and run "qlmdenoiser qlm_list.txt" which will process and replace all the .exr files with denoised ones.
