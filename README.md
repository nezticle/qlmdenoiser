Command line tool using OpenImageDenoise
https://www.openimagedenoise.org/ to denoise qlm_*.exr lightmaps
generated by Qt Quick 3D.

OpenImageDenoise and TBB are included and will be built as static
libraries. In addition the Intel ISPC compiler is
needed. https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html If the compiler is not
at c:\ispc\bin\ispc.exe or $HOME/ispc/bin/ispc then edit the scripts
first.

Only x64 and arm64 are supported. Other architectures are out of
question, this is due to what OIDN supports. Only Windows, Linux and
macOS (i.e. the desktop platforms relevant for tooling) can be
expected to work.

Run prepare_deps.bat or prepare_deps.sh first. Then qt-cmake-private
-CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . and ninja.  This gives a qlmdenoiser[.exe]
binary that hopefully can be used and shipped on its own, with the 3rd
party dependencies linked in statically.

Once this is done, bake lightmaps and run "qlmdenoiser qlm_list.txt"
(the lightmapper generates this file as well, listing all the
qlm_*.exr files generated). This will then process and replace all the
.exr files with denoised ones.
