Command line tool using OpenImageDenoise to denoise qlm_*.exr lightmaps
generated by Qt Quick 3D.

See https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/quick3d-lightmap.html for lightmap
baking details.

Qt is not required for building this tool.

OpenImageDenoise and TBB are included and will be built as static libraries.

In addition, the Intel ISPC compiler is required. See
https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html
If the ispc binary is not available in your path, then export ISPC_EXECUTABLE to
the location of the ispc binary before running the prepare_deps script.

Run **prepare_deps.bat** or **prepare_deps.sh** first.

Then **cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .** and **ninja**. This gives a
qlmdenoiser[.exe] binary that hopefully can be used and shipped on its own,
with the third-party dependencies linked in statically.

Once this is done, bake lightmaps and run "qlmdenoiser qlm_list.txt". This will
then process and replace all the .exr files with denoised ones. (the .txt file
is generated by the lightmap baking process, it just lists the names of all the
generated qlm_*.exr files)

Supported platforms:
* Windows x64
* Linux x64 (arm64 untested)
* macOS x64 and arm64

Includes the following third-party dependencies:
