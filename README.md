Command line tool using OpenImageDenoise
https://www.openimagedenoise.org/ to denoise qlm_*.exr lightmaps
generated by Qt Quick 3D.

OpenImageDenoise and TBB are included and will be built as static
libraries. In addition the Intel ISPC compiler is
needed. https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html

TODO this whole setup is fairly useless for anything but very manual
builds.

Run prepare_deps.bat or prepare_deps.sh first. Then qt-cmake-private
-CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . and ninja.  This gives a qlmdenoiser.exe
with the 3rd party dependencies linked in statically.

Once this is done, bake lightmaps and run "qlmdenoiser qlm_list.txt"
(the lightmapper generates this file as well, listing all the
qlm_*.exr files generated). This will then process and replace all the
.exr files with denoised ones.
